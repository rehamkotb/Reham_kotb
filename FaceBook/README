=====> for design pattern <=====

-- I've used POM(page object model) design patterm to seprate web elemnts as per web page name and test script how to increase maintainability of code
and I've implmeneted PageObject using page factory

-- Page Factory approach support lazy initialization by overloaded method "initElemnts" to intialize page objects
	(if webelemnt not used of page object class that element will never be searched for)

====> for framework <====

-- I've used DataDriven from excel sheet.
to read the date from excel then write optput data to excel
